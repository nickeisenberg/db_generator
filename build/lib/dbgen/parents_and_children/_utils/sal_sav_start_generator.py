def sal_sav_start_gen(avg, fkr):
    """
    This class attempts to produce a relatively believable salary, savings and 
    startdate for a person based on the average salary of their job.

    The startdate is randomly selected inbetween Jan 1, 2000 and Aug 15, 2023.
    
    The work duration is calculated as the amount of time one has spent 
    at the job between the startdate and Aug 15, 2023.
    
    If the avg_sal > 0 then the generated salary is based off of the sum 
    of two componets 
        1) max(normal(avg_sal, avg_sal / 4), avg_sal / 10)
        2) max(np.random.gamma(.1, avg_sal) - np.random.gamma(.1, avg_sal), 0)
    (1) is basically the average base salary and is bounded below by a tenth
    of the average salary. (2) basically is random noise that is prodominately
    zero, however can occasionally become very large, which then introduces an 
    outlier salary for those who happend to be at the very top of their
    field.

    If the avg_sal > 0 then the savings is based off of the 
    work duration and salary and is generated to be 
        np.random.normal(
            salary * work_duration / 4,
            salary / 8,
        )
    If this value is negative then that is taken to mean that the person is in 
    debt.
    If the avg_sal = 0, ie the person is unemployed, then this persons savings
    is simulated to be
        np.random.gamma(.5, 50) - np.random.gamma(.1, 50)
    There is no particular reason that I chose this for the savings of a 
    person with no salary other than the fact that I thought the histogram 
    after simulated 1000 samples looked nice.
