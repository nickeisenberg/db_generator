# How to use
* Make some instructions...

```python
import sqlalchemy as db
import pandas as pd
from dbgen.parents_and_children import create

database_url = "dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database"

engine = db.create_engine(
    database_url
)

create(engine)

# query from the database into a pandas dataframe
query = "select * from children where same_residence = True"
query_df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
```

# A list of questions
1. Find the average salaries of each of the professions
2. Within each profession, what is the percentage of people that make less than
the average.
3. Find the average saving for the employees that have worked for longer than
5 years
4. Find the top three employees in terms of savings within the job that has
the third-highest average salary. List the names of these employees.
5. Find the average number of children that employees have within each job.

average of their parents are earning. List the names of the top three children
according to their salaries.
7. On average, do the children who live in the same residence as their parents
or the children who do not live with their parents earn more money. Again,
assume that the child's salary is 30% of what their parents earn.
8. List the average savings of the parents with no child, one child and more

assuming that if the child works, then he or she earns %30 of the average of
